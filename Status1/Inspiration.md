## Inspiration.md
The main inspiration I'm drawing from is UFO 50, a collection of 50 retro
inspired games made by modern game developers. That also means I'm taking 
inspiration from the NES games of the 80s that this collection imitates. 
Although, I feel that a lot of the games in this collection are a step above
the most NES games in quality. My main point of inspiration comes from how each of 
these games keeps it relatively simple and copies the aesthetic of retro games 
but has some aspect to it (usually a core gameplay mechanic) that subverts your 
expectations and makes the game stand out. I know I probably don't have the
time to make a game as polished as these, but I want to design my game with this 
same balance of simplicity and creativity when it comes to gameplay mechanics. 

Some of my favorite examples from the collection are:
- Mooncat, a platformer with a weird 2-button control scheme, left and right, 
that has you perform different combinations of these inputs to do actions
like jumping, running, sliding, etc.
- Party House, a deckbuilder roguelike that replaces cards with party guests and
has you balance different guest's unique effects to beat levels
- Mini & Max, another platformer that takes place entirely in the protagonist's
bedroom, allowing you to shrink and grow at any point, changing the environment 
and level design based on your current size
