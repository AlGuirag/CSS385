Although I don't have any concrete plans for my game at the moment, one idea I
had for a game is a puzzle platformer centered around time travel. The core
mechanic would allow the player to cycle between the present and past at any 
time, opening up opportunities for really creative level design that forces 
players to think about how they might solve environmental puzzles. A basic 
example of this might be a bridge that exists in the past but is ruined in 
the present, forcing the player to have to change timelines to pass. Right now,
I'm deciding between using Godot and Unreal for my game engine since both have
pretty extensive documentation and are easy to get into.
